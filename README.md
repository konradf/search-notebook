This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Missing parts

- Unit tests
- E2E tests (lack of time)
- Handle fetch errors with user friendly messages
- Refactor QueryResults to useReducer, too many state values

## Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
